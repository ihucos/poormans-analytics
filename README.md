# poormans-analytics

```
My peronsal visitor counter for ihucos/covid19-dashboard (corona-aktuell.net)

https://poormans-analytics.herokuapp.com/increment/
increment counter for that day

https://poormans-analytics.herokuapp.com/fetch/
fetch csv of dates and counter values

Why did I do this?
Because all analytics tools are expensive and/or you need to show cookie-banners.
